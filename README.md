Tutoring Help from TA Luna 11/17: - Joined dataframe invoice date - ensure printing to show work through each step

Xpert Assistant feedback: - Assisted in:
	- Combine sales data by rows: reseting index errors
	- Utilizing .isnull instead of dropna
	- Learned that d.types is a property of a df not a method, I initially added a () improperly
	- Helped with first pivot table structure for index formatting error - needed [] for index versus only listing with commas
